Overview of Synaptic Probabilities Software
===========================================

The following instructions describe the general process to rebuild or update synapic probabilities materials.

## Rebuilding or Updating

If a prior version of the Synaptic Probabilities database tables exists, backup that before adding new material to reference 
the original material for comparison. For example, export a hippocampome database with the synaptic probabilities tables. Optionally, 
an extra copy of that exported database can be made with a name such as hippocampome2. This can help with comparing new table content
created by rebuilding the tables with the material in the prior tables.
