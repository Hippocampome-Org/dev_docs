Firing rate control
===================

These are descriptions of ideas related to simulation firing rate control and possible future directions of such work.

## The article's approach

In the article, the archetype simulated cells projects were from different animals and/or different grid module scales. The purpose of this was to avoid the scope of work attempting to have precise control over firing rates of grid cells recorded in the same animal, in the same naural layer (and grid cell module by extension), and recorded at the same time. This level of firing rate control was considered out-of-scope of the current work because it may involve biophysics and/or cellular mechanism beyond that which is included in the current model. Additional details explaining this information further will be covered here.
