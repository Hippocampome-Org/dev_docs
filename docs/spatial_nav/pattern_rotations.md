Grid pattern rotation methods
=============================

This documentation will prodive further information about concepts involved with grid pattern rotations and methods to create them in the simulation.

## Grid pattern rotations in real cells

It can be observed in real cell recordings that rotations are present. This can be observed in plots in this work's article and many other articles. A grid pattern rotation is the rotation of the six grid fields surrounding a center grid field being rotated around an axis positioned at the middle of that center grid field.
