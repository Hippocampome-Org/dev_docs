Converting animal recordings data for simulation use
====================================================

## Find data files containing grid cells

Data files can be batch processed with scripting to identify which cell files contain grid cell firing. Grid cell plots can be previewed with [CMBHome's](https://github.com/hasselmonians/CMBHOME) Visualize Matlab script. If using data from ([Dannenburg et al., 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/62500)), then grid patterns of interest can be previewed in the supp. mat. plots ([link](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/62500/elife-62500-fig6-data1-v2.pdf)).
