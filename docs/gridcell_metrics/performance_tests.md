GridMet Performance Tests
=========================

## Performance Testing Criteria
<br>The criteria used to identify the correct detection of fields included that field detection would be assess through visual inspection of original autocorrelogram plots compared to GridMetâ€™s field detection plots. Only the central seven fields in the plots are used for field detection in these tests. The software was required to detect those seven fields and not incorrectly include a field from a further distance from the plot center instead of any of those fields. Size of the detected field relative to that in the recorded cell plot was not considered in evaluating correct detection because that was considered to be too subjective. GridMet was also required to not detect more than one field as a single field in a way that merges the fields. A caveat to this is that autocorrelograms can in a variety of cases merge fields at their borders, and if it appeared difficult in visual inspection to understand the separation of such fields then the automated detection was not penalized for its detection of those fields.
